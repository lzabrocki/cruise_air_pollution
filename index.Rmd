Hello and welcome!

This website gathers all the codes used in our paper entitled *Estimating the Local Air Pollution Impacts of Maritime Traffic: A Principled Approach for Observational Data* by [Léo Zabrocki](https://lzabrocki.github.io/), [Marion Leroutier](https://marionleroutier.weebly.com/) and [Marie-Abèle Bind](https://biostatistics.massgeneral.org/faculty/marie-abele-bind-phd/).

Our data are stored on the Open Science Framework at the following address: https://osf.io/v8aps/. 

Even if we strive to make our study reproducible, its full replication presents two caveats:

* First, we were not allowed to share the weather data from Météo-France. We therefore added a small amount of noise to the original data.
* Second, the matching procedure at the hourly level is computationally demanding. We had to rent an Amazon Web Services virtual computer (EC2 t3.2xlarge) to run the matching algorithm.
