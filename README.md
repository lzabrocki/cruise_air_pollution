# Estimating the Local Air Pollution Impacts of Maritime Traffic: A Principled Approach for Observational Data

This repo provides all the codes to reproduce the analysis of our paper entitled *Estimating the Local Air Pollution Impacts of Maritime Traffic: A Principled Approach for Observational Data*. Data are archived on an Open Science Framework repository: https://osf.io/v8aps/. Some noise was added to weather data as we were not allowed by Météo-France to share them publicly.

The repository is organized to render the annotated codes as a Distill website, which can be found at this link: https://lzabrocki.github.io/cruise_air_pollution/.

* The folder docs contains the .html pages to render the website.
* index.Rmd is the homepage of the website.
* .Rmd files starting with `1_` are used for the hourly level analysis of the impacts of maritime traffic on air pollution in Marseille. The second digit indicates the chronological order of the analysis. Files starting with `2_` are for the daily level analysis and are structured in the same way.
